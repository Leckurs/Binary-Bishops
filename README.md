A group project to create a simple chess game using the programming language python.
<br>
Main requirements included learning the python language and using the github.
<br>

*1. What have we laenred?*
<br> *2. WHAT DIFFICULTIES DID WE FACE ?*

MONISHA SHIL>> This project work forced me to learn python language from the scratch making the topics like binary/linear search, creating shapes using for loop and many other basic topics very clear.
>> Not having any previous knowledge about the programming language consumed a lot of time just to learn the language and not having ever worked on github led to meeting up in person for the coding.
